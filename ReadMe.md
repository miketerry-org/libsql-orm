#Better-Sqlite3-ORM

This package is still under considerable active development. It is being used in several applications but there a number of planned features before reaching version 1.0.0. Every effort will be made to introduce no breaking changes, with the exception of the optional "dbInstance" parameter passed to most functions in the "models.js" file. We are evaluating the usefulness of this parameter and will likely remove it before version 1.0.0. Another likely change is to change all of the column definition functions into javascript classes allowing for more flexibility in the features columns support and the definition of custom column types. This may be done before reaching version 1.0.0 or may wait until version 2.0.0.

The "docs/" folder contains generated html documentation for the copious jsdocs comments throught the source code. This documentation is very incomplete and will be accessible on "www.miketerry.org" once it is ready for public consumption.

A companion repo is being developed with multiple example programs. We will update the version number for this package when the new example repo is ready for your use. These example programs will be thoroughly documented and available on the same website.

There is no road map available at this time. You cann use the command:

npm show better-sqlite3-orm

terminal command to see if a newer version of the package is available.
